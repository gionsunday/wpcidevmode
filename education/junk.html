      <h2>Mobile Screening Units: Taking Services to the People</h2>
      <p>
        WCPI’s mobile mammography unit has become a critical part of our outreach. In partnership with diagnostic centers,
        we've expanded access to screenings by taking state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment directly to underserved communities.
        Our mobile units have reached over <strong>7,000 women</strong> and we aim to scale this across all six geopolitical zones in Nigeria.
